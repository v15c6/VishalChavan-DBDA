# Amazon EC2 Security Groups

A security group acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances. When you launch an instance, 
you can specify one or more security groups; otherwise, we use the default security group.You can modify the rules for a security group 
at any time. New and modified rules are automatically applied to all instances that are associated with the security group.
