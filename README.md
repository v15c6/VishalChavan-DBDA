# WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING?

#### The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. In simple terms,Clouds are basically the resources we get on rent,we have to pay only for the resources we want to use. 

# TYPES OF CLOUD

* ####  Public Cloud 
The public cloud is defined as computing services making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage or bandwidth they consume.

* #### Private Cloud
A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organisation. A private cloud can be physically located on the company’s on-site datacenter. example: for example if vita had a private cloud it can only be accessed by employees of vita.

* #### Hybrid Cloud
Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them.
example: if Vita had an hybrid cloud than the private part would be for the employees and the public part would be for students.

# WHY CLOUD?

* Cost: Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters.
* Speed: Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks.
* Security: Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies and controls that strengthen your security overall.
* Performance: The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware.
* Reliability: Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.


# TYPES OF SERVICES


* #### IaaS
Infrastructure as a service(IaaS). With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.

* #### PaaS
Platform as a service (PaaS). PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.

* #### SaaS
Software as a service (SaaS). With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching.

# GET STARTED
To get started with using AWS Cloud, you should have aws account access you can also try free trail version which basically provides you
30$ to access the services of aws.
